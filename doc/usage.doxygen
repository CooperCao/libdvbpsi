/*! \page usage API usage

<p>When the application needs a new decoder it just has to call the
<em>dvbpsi_AttachXXX()</em> function where XXX is the name of the table
(ex: dvbpsi_AttachPAT()). The function returns a handle on the new
decoder.</p>

<p>Then the application has to send the TS packets needed by the decoder
by calling the dvbpsi_PushPacket() function. If a new table is complete
then the decoder calls the callback specified by the application when it
called <em>dvbpsi_AttachXXX()</em>.</p>

<p>When the application don't need the decoder anymore it just has to
call the <em>dvbpsi_DetachXXX()</em> function (ex:
dvbpsi_DetachPAT()).</p>

<p>Be careful! If a table wasn't active (b_current_next == 0) and the
next is the same but active (b_current_next == 1) then the lists
contained by the table structure are empty and should be caught from the
previous structure.</p>

<p>In this version of <em>libdvbpsi</em> the descriptors aren't decoded.
These decoders will come in the next release.</p>

<p>For specific tools, the best to do is to have a look at the include
file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Program Specific Information: psi.h</li>
  <li>Descriptors: descriptor.h</li>
  <li>Program Association Table: pat.h</li>
  <li>Program Map Table: pmt.h</li>
</ul>
